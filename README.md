# Bondora Peer-to-peer Lending Data

Credit Products: Personal Loans, Peer-to-peer

Details: 

Data for the study has been retrieved from a publicly available data set of a leading European P2P lending platform, Bondora (https://www.bondora.com/en). The retrieved data is a pool of both defaulted and non-defaulted loans from the time period between 1st March 2009 and 27th January 2020. The data comprises demographic and financial information of borrowers and loan transactions. In P2P lending, loans are typically uncollateralized and lenders seek higher returns as compensation for the financial risk they take. In addition, they need to make decisions under information asymmetry that works in favor of the borrowers. In order to make rational decisions, lenders want to minimize the risk of default of each lending decision and realize the return that compensates for the risk. As in the financial research domain, there are very few datasets available that can be utilized for building and analyzing credit risk models. This dataset will help the research community in building and performing research in the credit risk domain.

| LossGivenDefault                       | Gives the percentage of outstanding exposure at the time of default that an investor is likely to lose if a loan actually defaults. This means the proportion of funds lost for the investor after all expected recovery and accounting for the time value of the money recovered. In general, LGD parameter is intended to be estimated based on the historical recoveries. However, in new markets where limited experience does not allow us more precise loss given default estimates, a LGD of 90% is assumed. |
